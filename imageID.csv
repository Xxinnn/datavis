Midday sun suffuses the panorama, its intensity heightening the artist's palette and suppressing incidental detail to clarify the crowded scene.",,93.7 x 75.3,93.7,75.3,36.88976378,29.64566929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
203,"Fog, Voisins",Alfred Sisley,1874,"Sisley, along with Monet, was one of the central proponents of the plein air technique, using this method in his famous paintings of the Voisins countryside, where he moved in 1871. Unlike Degas, Renoir, Cassatt, or Morisot, Sisley focused almost expressly on representations of the atmosphere while diminishing the importance of the human figure, if they appeared at all. Fog, Voisins demonstrates this general preoccupation with the visual perception of the natural world through the application of rough, clearly visible brushstrokes and the blurry, almost ethereal rendering of color and form.",,50.5 x 65,50.5,65,19.88188976,25.59055118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
204,"The Terrace at Saint-Germain, Spring",Alfred Sisley,1875,"In this panoramic view of the Seine River valley near the town of St.-Germain-en-Laye, Sisley captures the atmosphere and light conditions associated with early spring. On the heights in the distance, he includes the old château that housed the French royal court until 1682, but he also inserts some notes of modernity, including the steam tugs hauling barges on the river and the railroad bridge. Sisley was born in France of English parents. While enrolled in Charles Gleyre's studio in Paris, he and his fellow students, Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, and Frédéric Bazille, began to paint outdoors in the Fontainebleau forest. In 1874, he showed five paintings in the first Impressionist exhibition. Of all the Impressionists, he and Monet would remain the most consistent landscape painters.",,w99.6 x h73.6 x d17.145,99.6,73.6,39.21259843,28.97637795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,"Paris Street, Rainy Day",Gustave Caillebotte,1877,"While the work of Gustave Caillebotte adheres to a distinctly realistic aesthetic that differs from most impressionistic renderings, his paintings reflect a similar concern with subjects of modern life. Paris Street, Rainy Day shows this tendency within his work, through the depiction of the typical urban scene; the panoramic view of the rain-drizzled boulevard presents the newly renovated metropolis, while the anonymous figures in the background emphasize the alienation of the individual within the city. The painting centers on the apathetic gaze of the male figure, who epitomizes the cool detachment of the flaneur, poised in his characteristic black coat and top hat. Like Caillebotte's other paintings, this work depicts the impact of modernity on the individual's psychology, the fleeting impressions of the street, and the effect of the changing urban sphere upon society.",83 1/2 x 108 3/4,212.2 x 276.2,212.2,276.2,83.54330709,108.7401575,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,In the Conservatory,Edouard Manet,1878/1879 - 1879,"Manet preferred compositions with two figures as opposed to the straightforward portrait form because it opened up the possibility of interesting dialogue situations. The double portrait of Jules Guillemet and his wife, painted in the conservatory of the painter Johann Georges Otto Rosen, is one of the most important of these works because of the sensitivity with which it uses the most delicate nuances of colours and contrasts to describe and re-connect the psychologically tense, only outwardly detached, relationship of the two figures. The theme of the picture is the interplay between the elegant lady — the owner of a fashion shop in Paris — and the gentlemen turned in her direction.",,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
207,Vetheuil in the Fog,Claude Monet,1880,"In this view of Vétheuil, seen from the opposite bank of the Seine, the flicker of individual brushstrokes reflects Monet's concern with recording sensations of color and light as accurately as possible. Ironically, this practice resulted in paintings of an increasingly abstract nature. Indeed, the imagery nearly dissolves in the myriad touches of pain",23 5/8 x 39 1/4,60 x 99.7,60,99.7,23.62204724,39.2519685,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,In the Loge,Mary Cassatt,1880,"Cassatt focused on modern subjects of the city under Haussmannization, while emphasizing, in particular, the private and public life of women. Here, she depicts the Palais Garnier of the Paris Opera, which was opened in 1875 and served as a focal point for the city's social life. As the painting demonstrates, the opera was not only a site for culture and entertainment, but also for seeing and being seen; the woman's binoculars, presumably directed at the stage, are echoed in the man's binoculars, across the concert hall, directed at her. Through this emphasis on looking, Cassatt arrives at a playful meditation on the act of visuality and the artist's gaze, which were central concerns of the Impressionist artists.",32 x 26 ,66 x 81.3,66,81.3,25.98425197,32.00787402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She looks straight ahead, a picture of poise and detachment even as she seems fully aware of the viewer's admiring gaze. Representing aspiring Parisian actress Jeanne Demarsy as the embodiment of Spring, this portrait debuted at the last major public exhibition of Manet's life, the Paris Salon of 1882. For more than two decades, Manet's paintings were rejected by the Salon or met with controversy; Spring was the most unalloyed success of the artist's Salon career, a career that ended tragically a year later when Manet died of causes related to syphilis.",29 1/8 x 20 1/4,74 x 51.5,74,51.5,29.13385827,20.27559055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,"Shadows on the Sea. The Cliffs at Pourville
",Claude Monet,1882,"In his treatment of the sea surface Monet’s Impressionist technique can be seen fully developed. Shadows, reflections and movements are depicted in a series of short, curved brushstrokes in pure, unmixed pigments. If one examines the painting from a distance while peering with half-open eyes, the elements flow together into an optic unity and the painting’s surface seems almost to vibrate – precisely as on a hot summer day by the sea, where the surface of the water is broken by the wind to become a million small, flashing mirrors. It is this impression Monet wishes to convey, just as he experienced it that day on the cliffs at Pourville in 1882.",,80 x 57,80,57,31.49606299,22.44094488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
211,Cliff Walk at Pourville,Claude Monet,1882,"In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women’s wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-ray imaging of the work reveals that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.",26 1/8 × 32 7/16,66.5 × 82.3,66.5,82.3,26.18110236,32.4015748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

213,"Rocks at Belle-Île, Port-Domois",Claude Monet,1886,"In ""Rocks at Belle-Île, Port-Domois,"" Monet depicted the grim sea beating away at the barren rocks, a theme he repeated and varied numerous times. He was sensitive to the topography of his surroundings and the need to alter his manner of looking accordingly. He wrote to his companion Alice Hoschedé, “I must make great efforts to make them [the rocks] somber, to render this sinister, tragic aspect.” He added that he felt “powerless to render the intensity” of the ocean crashing upon the rocky sentinels of the island. Yet he also recognized that he placed great demands on himself: “I’m chasing the merest sliver of color. It’s my own fault, I want to grasp the intangible.” The colors, forms, and atmosphere of this magnificent painting reveal that Monet was concerned as much with conveying turbulent emotion as with recording the appearance of a particular site.",32 x 25 1/2,81.3 x 64.8,81.3,64.8,32.00787402,25.51181102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surveying the view from his lodgings at the Grand Hôtel de Russie in early 1897, Pissarro marveled that he could ""see down the whole length of the boulevards"" with ""almost a bird's-eye view of carriages, omnibuses, people, between big trees, big houses that have to be set straight."" From February through April, he recorded—in two scenes of the boulevard des Italiens to the right, and fourteen of the boulevard Montmartre to the left—the spectacle of urban life as it unfolded below his window.",25 1/2 x 32,64.8 x 81.3,64.8,81.3,25.51181102,32.00787402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composition of the sailboats and marines in the foreground is balanced by the cityscape with a monumental mosque structure in the background. The artist’s use of vibrant colors and his efforts to capture the shimmering effects of the constant change of light with a fast, dynamic brushstroke technique dominate the painting. This style has led Ziem to be compared with Impressionist painters, even to be regarded as an artist who foreshadowed the emergence of Impressionism with his work.",,113 x 69,113,69,44.48818898,27.16535433,,,,,,,,,,cubism,5,,,,

Seurat composed the entire scene from a series of small, precise dots of color. If viewed closely, the painting becomes nothing more than a quasi-abstract array of colors, similar to a needlepoint. When viewed at an appropriate distance, however, Sunday Afternoon comes into focus. Seurat carefully placed each dot in relation to the ones around it in order to create the desired optical effect. He did so in order to bring structure and rationality to what he perceived were the triviality and disorganization rampant in Impressionism.",81.7 in × 121.25 in,207.6 × 308,207.6,308,81.73228346,121.2598425,,,,,,,,,,expressionism,6,,,,

But by the time he made this work, a year later, he had clearly shifted his allegiance from the Old Masters to the Parisian avant-garde. Under the influence of Neo-Impressionist color theory, he based this painting on the contrast of complementary colors. The overall blue-green tone of the background serves as a foil to the orange-red of the artist’s hair and beard.

This work from the first half of his stay in Brittany represents a transitional stage from the Impressionist style to his own more planar forms. While the palette is subdued and the touch resembles that of the Impressionists, each form of the separate objects is expressed in large color blocks edged by outlines, clearly foreshadowing the style that would emerge in the latter half of Gauguin's stay in Brittany.

These color planes highlighted the fact that the viewer's eye observed a scene both simultaneously and consecutively.

For the water and sky, de Vlaminck used a range of blues and greens, as well as dazzling white highlights applied in choppy dabs; the two red-and-orange trees at the left provide a lively contrast. The finished effect is one of brightness and vibrating motion; detail and traditional perspective matter far less than a sense of buoyant pleasure.

The arrangement of figures in a circular dance is a centuries-old motif, often used to suggest a golden age of harmony and leisure. However, by simplifying and distorting his dancers' anatomy for expressive purposes, and painting them in a vibrant, non-naturalistic red against a flat ground of blue sky and green earth, Matisse emphasized the primordial aspect of dance.

Avery has achieved subtleties of tone with a limited range of color and a scumbled texture with his brushwork, in which thin layers of pigment were rubbed onto the canvas with a stiff brush, producing a swirl of marks.

614,War,Jackson Pollock,1947,"Pollock's famous ""War"" is the only drawing he ever titled, and, although inscribed ""1947,"" it relates to the iconographically complex images he produced earlier, around 1943–44. In this composition, the monstrous destruction of war is conveyed both by the fierceness of the graphic execution and by the imagery, much of which is camouflaged by the many linear motions, darkened and thickened and highlighted with flashes of red and yellow pencil to heighten the dramatic intensity. The drawing's narrative is one of horrific proportions. A human figure and a bull are flung onto a raging pyre of human debris. To the right, the crucifixion of a hooded figure is suggested. Some of the imagery may be traced to Picasso's pair of etchings ""The Dream and Lie of Franco,"" and to the Spanish artist's epic painting on war, ""Guernica,"" both from 1937. Yet even as Pollock's work engages with the history of art and offers a statement on the universal horrors of war, it also has a personal dimension, drawing on from the psychological language of Surrealism that fueled his early works.",20 5/8 x 26 in.,66 x 52.5,66.04,52.5145,26,20.675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
615,Attic,Willem de Kooning,1949,"Between 1946 and 1949, de Kooning produced a series of highly abstract black-and-white-paintings that culminated in ""Attic,"" in which angular, thrusting forms collide with organic, curvilinear ones to yield a high-pitched, expressive picture. The dense web of white shapes and black lines makes it difficult to sort out relationships between form and space, though it is still possible to determine a figural basis for the scene. Stretched across the canvas are biomorphic symbols and shapes that allude to the curves and forms of human anatomy. De Kooning's palette of black and white, with touches of red and yellow, was determined in part by the availability of inexpensive commercial enamel paint. Although restricted in his use of color, de Kooning displays virtuosity in his sensuous, expressive handling of paint, surface, and line. His gestural brushwork and dynamic allover composition exemplify the new visual language adopted by the Abstract Expressionist painters. De Kooning routinely made revisions on his canvases, and ""Attic"" was exhibited at two different stages of completion. To accelerate the drying time of the paint, he blotted sheets of newspaper over the wet canvas, and the surface bears evidence of transferred newsprint. Immediately following ""Attic,"" de Kooning reintroduced full color into his work, already hinted at here in the touches of red and yellow, and he soon returned to the figurative imagery for which he is best known.",61 7/8 x 81 in.,206.7 x 157.2,206.6925,157.1625,81.375,61.875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
616,Autumn Rhythm (Number 30),Jackson Pollock,1950,"In Autumn Rhythm, as in many of his paintings, Pollock first created a complex linear skeleton using black paint. For this initial layer the paint was diluted, so that it soaked into the length of unprimed canvas, thereby inextricably joining image and support. Over this black framework Pollock wove an intricate web of white, brown, and turquoise lines, which produce the contrary visual rhythms and sensations: light and dark, thick and thin, heavy and buoyant, straight and curved, horizontal and vertical. Textural passages that contribute to the painting's complexity — such as the pooled swirls where two colors meet and the wrinkled skins formed by the build-up of paint — are barely visible in the initial confusion of overlapping lines. Although Pollock's imagery is nonrepresentational, Autumn Rhythm is evocative of nature, not only in its title but also in its coloring, horizontal orientation, and sense of ground and space.",105 x 207 in.,525.8 x 266.7,525.78,266.7,207,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

618,Winter Pool,Robert Rauschenberg,1959,"Winter Pool, the first painting by Rauschenberg to enter the Museum's collection, is a prime example of a very important period in this highly inventive and influential artist's work—the mid-1950s to the early 1960s—when he created bold objects that were a hybrid of painting and sculpture and a reinvention of collage. He called them Combines. In Cubist collage, pasted papers add up to a readable image, such as a still life. With Combines, there is no narrative and the interpretation is left to the viewer. The work, in exceptionally fresh condition, consists of two separate canvases, each about the height of a man. A wooden ladder bridges the gap between them, and its legs extend to the floor, inviting the viewer to climb into the picture. The compositions of both canvases consist of syncopated grids formed by rectangles of paint and found objects: shirt cuffs, a handkerchief, poster letters, and photographic reproductions. Rauschenberg's virtuoso handling of paint both exploits and confronts the dominant painterly style of the early 1950s—Abstract Expressionism—and undermines the Renaissance notion that a painting shows an ideal world behind the canvas surface.",H. 90-1/2 x W. 59-1/2 x D. 4 in.,151.1 x 230,151.13,229.87,59.5,90.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the unfolded tablecloth a meal is arranged, with an assortment of overlapping objects that undergo a thorough Cubist analysis: a carafe, a Chianti bottle, a bowl, a cup and saucer, a pitcher, a plate, and a bouquet of flowers. As distinct from other working sketches of the still life, the Lehman drawing is primarily a linear exercise, a study of line as it passes rhythmically through objects and space.

The work is widely regarded as a Modernist classic and has become one of the most famous of its time. Before its first presentation at the Parisian 1912 Salon des Indépendants, it was rejected by the Cubists as too Futurist.

First conceived in 1919, the work is one of what Duchamp referred to as readymades, or more specifically a rectified ready-made.[1] The readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work Fountain) simply renaming them and placing them in a gallery setting. In L.H.O.O.Q. the objet trouvé (""found object"") is a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.",,12.4 x 19.7 ,12.4,19.7,4.881889764,7.755905512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
705,Construction for Noble Ladies,Kurt Schwitters,1919,"The years immediately after World War I were filled with great ferment and experimentation. In this climate, poet, artist, and photographer Kurt Schwitters developed his own unique aesthetic, which he called ""Merz"". The concept was based on assemblage — the combining of ordinary objects with artistic elements. For Schwitters, Merz was an attempt to achieve freedom from all social, political, and cultural fetters. Construction for Noble Ladies is one of Schwitters's large-scale reliefs known as Merzbilder (Merz pictures). It is revolutionary in its incorporation of everyday detritus — a funnel, broken wheels, a flattened metal toy train, and a ticket for shipping a bicycle by train — yet like other Merzbilder, it remains an elegantly composed picture. A traditional portrait of a ""noble lady"" in profile, turned on her side and facing upward, is also included. These various found materials, seemingly whimsical and casual, are transformed into formal artistic elements by their arrangement according to Cubist principles.

He derived this composition from a photograph he captured of sheets hanging from a clothesline in the backyard of a New York City slum. The painting’s title suggests that the image of sheets blowing in the wind reminded him of ship sails and, more specifically, of the celebrated and tragic opera by Richard Wagner (1813–1883), The Flying Dutchman, the name of a ghost ship doomed to sail aimlessly forever, its sails in tatters.",18-1/2 × 24-1/2 in.,62.2 x 47,62.23,46.99,24.5,18.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In it, Höch takes aim at the hypocrisies and moral bankruptcy of the Weimar Republic through the radical techniques of disorientation, negation, and disjunction.This new, fragmented art of cut and pasted clippings from the mass media allowed the Dadaists, in the words of George Grosz, to say ""in pictures what would have been banned by the censors."" Here, Höch sets into motion a swirling, anarchic panoply of military leaders, crowds, spinning machine parts, cabaret dancers, and Dadaist pranksters; the work's engagement with the social praxis--in terms of both its subject and its construction--marks a decisive rupture with traditional bourgeois modes of expression. Höch often reworked her photomontages, and this image records a crucial revision in the image's development: the removal of the charged textual fragment ""Weltrevolution"" (World Revolution) and its replacement by the relatively innocuous ""Die grosse Welt Dada"" (Big Dada World).",5 1/4 x 3 7/8 in.,9.8 x 13.3,9.8425,13.335,3.875,5.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After making the exposure, Man Ray characteristically disassembled the magnet-and-pistol device, leaving only this single original print as the reminder of a provocative Dada idea.

712,Pragerstrasse,Otto Dix,1920,"Otto Dix paints the street in which he lived in Dresden. In this street is represented the society of the postwar period: a society haunted by death, dehumanized and in full crisis. His work first seeks to denounce the horrors of war and fighting that have destroyed many soldiers (so-called ""broken mouths""). An impression of confusion and imbalance emerges from the table. Otto Dix wants to make uncomfortable, even shock the viewer. Pragerstrassealso shows the social crisis of the post-war society. In fact, the construction of the painting reveals a dislocated humanity. The sidewalk with its cigarette butts, garbage, newspaper stubs and mutilates highlights an inferior world. This lower world is despised by a higher world of which only a part is visible (the body of a woman on the right, the hand of a man resting on a cane on the left). Each world ignores the other. The painter thus shows a society without compassion and without respect for the human person. Finally, Otto Dix denounces anti-Semitism (= hatred of the Jews).

Shot in Man Ray's room on the rue de la Condamine (next door to his friend Marcel Duchamp), the photograph shows one of his violent sculpture-objects (such as the pistol-with-magnet entitled Compass of two years earlier) dangling over the poet, who coolly ignores his doubly assured destruction with the wave of a cigarette.

However, from 1908 on, elements of Fauvism and Neo-Impressionism, as well as Cubism and other modes of abstraction, would appear in his work; he later joined the Puteaux Group, of which Guillaume Apollinaire, Robert Delaunay, and Marcel Duchamp were members. The year 1915 marked the beginning of Picabia’s “machinist” period, during which he produced works inspired by industrial developments, such as Machine turn quickly (1916–18) and his satirical drawing Universal Prostitution(1916), which was intended to take a jab at bourgeois sexuality. While in Barcelona in 1917, Picabia launched a Dada periodical titled 391 after Alfred Stieglitz’s periodical 291, though he eventually denounced Dada and returned to figurative painting. In the ’40s, his practice took a surprising turn as he began to paint nudes in the style of French glamour magazines, as in Femmes au bull-dog (1942).

716,Ubu Imperator,Max Ernst,1923,"Like many of Ernst's paintings during his Paris period (1922-1941), Ubu Imperator resembles a collage in painted form. The artist's knowledge of theories by renowned psychologist Freud, familiarity with myth and extreme wit are reflected in this early painting, which is now considered proto-Surrealist due to its strange juxtapositions.In Ubu Imperator, an anthropomorphic top dances in a vast, empty landscape. Such works captured early on the surrealist notion of estrangement and commitment to the subconscious, but also they seem surprisingly contemporary. The red Ubu Imperator marked the entry of Ernst in the articulated stage of surrealism by his use of a literary narrative that was sometimes personal, sometimes political. In this seminal work a spinning top, a red carcass with iron reinforcement, and human hands express an astonishing image of the Ubu Father, a grotesque symbol of authority invented by Alfred Jarry. Other paintings suggest Ernst's impressions of ancient Buddhist temples (à la Angkor Wat) as inspired from his trip to Asia following the breakup of his famous ménage à trois with Gala and Paul Eluard.

In the far distance, a tiny woman holds onto some undefined winged being. The strange patterns on the bodies of the main figures, which evoke fossils or geological formations, are the result of grattage (scraping). In this technique, the artist coated the canvas, or in this case, a piece of cardboard, with layers of paint and while it was still wet pressed it against objects that left imprints on the surface.

Painterly Architectonic is one of a series of works Popova created between 1915 and 1919 in response to Kazimir Malevich's Suprematist paintings.

He produced this politically charged work in support of the Red Army shortly after the Bolsheviks had waged their revolution in 1917. The red wedge symbolized the revolutionaries, who were penetrating the anti-Communist White Army. Here Lissitzky uses his signature coded color combination of red, white and black, which reinforces the message indicated by the work's title. Colors and shapes take on directly symbolic significance. For example, the smooth, curvilinear walls of the white circle are pierced by the sharp point of the red triangle: the Red Army has pierced the defenses of the White Army. Dramatic color contrasts also create confusion regarding space-which area is positive? Which is negative? Meanwhile, small geometric forms in the limited color scheme float like tiny projectiles through the space along with text. Here, basic forms combine with actual text: painting and typography are fused.

In these compositions, which are notable for the precision of their forms, their balance and their clarity, he uses architectural devices but strips them of their architectural function and gives them a new aesthetic value. Furthermore, in his Prounpaintings Lissitzky found a way of reconciling Tatlin’s utilitarian ideas with Malevich’s Utopian aesthetic and succeeded in developing Suprematism in space.",,55.5 x 70,55.5,70,21.8503937,27.55905512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

810,"Pure Red Color, Pure Yellow Color, Pure Blue Color",Aleksandr Rodchenko,1921,"Traditionally, color is used in art to describe the appearance of a particular object, or else to lend associations (the blue traditionally used to depict the Virgin Mary's robes in Renaissance paintings carried symbolic meanings). But Rodchenko's triptych focuses only on the material character of color, and it is considered the first artwork to do so. Here, red, blue, and yellow are used neither to describe an object nor to elicit certain associations; instead they are presented almost as a palette from which the artist can work. This is typical of the Constructivist attitude to materials, which was focused not on transforming them into art but on utilizing their properties in the most honest and effective ways possible. The triptych might be read as a rejection of the mysticism that seemed to tinge some work by Rodchenko's Suprematist contemporary, Kazimir Malevich. Rodchenko wrote of it, in 1921, ""I reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, yellow. I affirmed: this is the end of painting. These are the primary colors. Every plane is a discrete plane and there will be no more representation.""",N/A,62.5 x 24 ,52.5,62.5,20.66929134,24.60629921,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of two studies for a larger oil painting, this composition uses different mediums to suggest a range of properties for the otherwise straightforward geometric forms, which become dynamic through their suspension within a precariously balanced visual field. Like all of the Prouns, this work is a highly refined object. Thus, while they parallel certain tenets of the Russian Constructivists, who used a similarly reductive visual vocabulary and sought to merge art and life through mass production and industry, Lissitzky’s Prouns lack the rough-hewn experimental nature of Contructivist objects, remaining more on the side of aesthetics than utility.

By 1921 she had abandoned painting to pursue the Constructivist ambition to leave behind traditional art forms and to make work for mass production. She concentrated on textile design, such as in this work, Popova uses repeating geometric patterns which were thought more appropriate to modern life and mass production than the floral designs that had previously been popular for such textiles. The intersecting circles and spacing of the stripes add tension and movement within the pattern, while also visually creating the effect of different textures. Popova's prominence within Constructivism is indicative of the significant role played by women in driving the movement's concerns; other avant-garde movements of the period were dominated by men.",,19.1 x 23.4,19.1,23.4,7.519685039,9.212598425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
816,Proun 99,El Lissitzky,1924,"El Lissitzky was a designer, typographer, architect, and photographer affiliated with the Soviet Constructivist and Suprematist movements. He studied and worked as an architect and engineer in Germany and Russia before receiving an invitation from Marc Chagall in 1919 to teach at the Vitebsk School of Art in Belarus. There he encountered painter Kasimir Malevich, the recent founder of the Suprematist movement, which strove to create a style of purely non-objective painting comprised of a language of geometric forms. In 1920 Lissitzky coined the term “Proun”—an acronym for the Russian words meaning “project for the affirmation of the new”—to refer to a series of abstract works that combined the Suprematist lexicon of geometric, monochromatic forms with tools of architectural rendering. In Proun 99, the large composite object that dominates the upper left quadrant could either be a cube or a recessed meeting of three planes. The gridded triangle at the bottom appears to create a sense of depth, yet the elements above it seem to exist in their own, gravity-less space. Through constructing a complex dimensional space that hovers between the coherent and the impossible, Lissitzky strives to evoke utopia—literally “no place”—and to achieve the task of inventing a new art for a post-revolutionary Soviet society.",,99.1 x 129,251.714,327.66,99.1,129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

820,"New York, Number 18",Charles Biederman,1938,"In the early years of his career as a painter, Charles Biederman studied Cézanne, Post-Impressionism, and Cubism before finally turning to total abstraction. His time in New York (1934-40) and his first trip to Paris in 1936 definitively shaped his art as he came into contact with the work of many European modernists, including Arp, Brancusi, Léger, Miró, and Mondrian, Pevsner, and Vantongerloo. He was particularly interested in Constructivism (with its use of industrial materials) and De Stijl (with its rigid geometry and primary color schemes), two art movements that produced geometric, nonobjective images. By 1937, Biederman's work was becoming more sculptural, and subsequent pieces, such as New York, Number 18 of 1938, were rendered as shallow, painted reliefs. These wall-hung panels-often incorporating wood and plastic materials-could be seen from various angles, and natural light and cast shadows enhanced the visual effect.

Biomorphic shapes are those that resemble organic beings but that are hard to identify as any specific thing; the shapes seem to self-generate, morph, and dance on the canvas. While there is the suggestion of a believable three-dimensional space in Harlequin's Carnival, the playful shapes are arranged with an all-over quality that is common to many of Miró's works during his Surrealist period, and that would eventually lead him to further abstraction. Miró was especially known for his use of automatic writing techniques in the creation of his works, particularly doodling or automatic drawing, which is how he began many of his canvases. He is best known for his works such as this that depict chaotic yet lighthearted interior scenes, taking his influence from Dutch 17th-century interiors such as those by Jan Steen.",,90.5 x 66,90.5,66,25.98425197,10.23002046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atop this relatively uncontrolled application of paint, he added lines and shapes he had previously planned in studies. The bird or kite, shooting star, balloon, and figure with white head may all seem somehow familiar, yet their association is illogical.

Describing his method, Miró said, “Rather than setting out to paint something I began painting and as I paint the picture begins to assert itself, or suggest itself under my brush.… The first stage is free, unconscious.”","8' 2 3/4"" x 6' 6 3/4""

Masson himself observed that male figures in his art rarely escape unharmed.

Masson believed that the use of chance in art would reveal the sadism of all creatures - an idea that he could only reveal in his art.","14 1/4 x 28 3/4""",73 x 36.2,73.025,36.195,28.75,14.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

André Breton welcomed him into the group in 1925. Tanguy was inspired by the biomorphic forms of Jean Arp, Ernst, and Miró, quickly developing his own vocabulary of amoeba-like shapes that populate arid, mysterious settings, no doubt influenced by his youthful travels to Argentina, Brazil, and Tunisia. Despite his lack of formal training, Tanguy's mature style emerged by 1927, characterized by deserted landscapes littered with fantastical rocklike objects painted with a precise illusionism.

He developed the paranoid-critical method, which involved systematic irrational thought and self-induced paranoia as a way to access his unconscious. He referred to the resulting works as ""hand-painted dream photographs"" because of their realism coupled with their eerie dream quality. The narrative of this work stems from Dalí's anxieties over his affair with Gala Eluard, wife of artist Paul Eluard. The lumpish white ""pebbles"" depict his insecurities about his future with Gala, circling around the concepts of terror and decay. While The Accommodations of Desire is an exposé of Dalí's deepest fears, it combines his typical hyper-realistic painting style with more experimental collage techniques.

Fragments of honky-tonk signs make reference to the resort’s popular attractions, such as Steeplechase Park and Feltman’s restaurant, where the hotdog was invented. The letters C-O-M allude to the commedia dell’arte, the European equivalent of secular Mardi Gras.", (77 × 84.75 in),215.3 x 195.6 ,195.6,215.3,77.00787402,84.76377953,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elements of the work point to current events—the Arab riding a camel refers to the Turco-Italian War of 1911 and flags indicate sentiments of nationalism. In his depiction of Bal Tabarin the artist merges his interest in capturing the dynamism of motion, shared with fellow Futurists, with the integration of text and collage elements, such as sequins, influenced by his study of French Cubism.",,135 x 100 ,135,100,53.1496063,39.37007874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1117,"Sappers at Work : Canadian Tunnelling Company, R14, St Eloi",David Bomberg,1918,"In 1914 the Germans, trying to break the stalemate of trench warfare, exploded mines under British positions at Festubert, in Belgium, inflicting terrible casualties. The British responded, recruiting professional miners, and by summer 1916 they had 33 companies of tunnellers at the Western Front.The tunnel at St Eloi was 1,650 feet long and 125 feet deep. It was used to explode the largest mine of the war. This was one of 19 mines exploded at the launch of the Messines offensive in June 1917 and helped the British 41st Division to capture the village.In 1918 David Bomberg, who had served in the Royal Engineers, was commissioned by the Canadian Government to paint the operation. Bomberg was a major figure in the London avant-garde, influenced by Cubism and Futurism. He reduced his subjects to geometric forms, full of tension and kinetic energy. The Canadians, however, asked him to avoid abstraction, and rejected his first painting as too Futurist. This work is a preparatory sketch for a second version, now in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, in which Bomberg compromised and produced a more representational work. The tension and geometry that interested Bomberg are still evident in the complex rhythm of the beams against the curved tunnel walls and in the figures' poses, but the bright colour and bold abstraction of the first work have disappeared. Bomberg has included himself in the foreground of the picture carrying a heavy beam to show his feeling of being burdened by this task.",,67.3 x 57.8,55.8,67.3,21.96850394,26.49606299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1119,Brooklyn Bridge,Joseph Stella,1920,"Completed in 1883 and hailed as an engineering wonder, the Brooklyn Bridge was recognized as a symbol of the modern city by artists and writers alike. Walt Whitman, John Marin, Hart Crane, Lewis Mumford, and Georgia O’Keeffe, for example, all paid homage to this structure. The bridge was viewed as more than an icon of the industrial age, though, for its design and construction fused the new technology of its innovative cable suspension with historical references to the past: the great Gothic arches of its towers linked the Old World and the New.",76 1/4 x 68 1/4 in,193.67 x 173.35 ,193.67,173.35,76.2480315,68.2480315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
